# Homework 4 - Building an ICO
In this homework we will build a ICO from scratch including developing the contracts, and frontend for token sale, as well as testing the whole stack and deploying it to Ropstein testnet.

We will do this as a team. all students will take turns to work on one of three teams:

1. **Smart-contract team**: Will write the contracts and deployment code.
2. **Auditing team**: Will write tests for the contracts to cover every possible aspect of their functionality.
3. **Frontend team**: Will develop the frontend web app, Which will run the token sale .

## Workflow
The work on this project will proceed according to the following workflow:
1. Each student will fork the [project repository](https://github.com/fccoelho/ICO-playground).
2. The repository will contain a branch named `<year>_project`. All pull requests should be made to this branch as each year's class will develop their own implementation. The master branch should only hold the basic starter code.
1. Students will clone their own forks locally and work from them. When they are ready to contribute they should make a pull request.
1. The instructor will open issues for the students to work on, and do the code review as part of course evaluation. Students which don't commit code, wont be graded. Pull-requests may contain commits from more than one student, but all students should strive to make as many commits as possible to obtain a more useful feedback from the instructor.
