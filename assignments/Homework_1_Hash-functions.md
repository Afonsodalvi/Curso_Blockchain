# Understanding a cryptographic hash functions


 > **Note:** you should never use your own implementation of a cryptographic scheme
in your code, unless you are a specialist in that algorithm. use a standard 
library instead.

In the Solution directory you will find pure python implementations of the `SHA-2` and `MD5` hash functions

We ask you to Analyse both implementations describing what each block of code does making references to the description of the algorithm provided on wikipedia.

## Bonus

Try to implement a simple hash function such as the [Rabin fingerprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabin%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm).
