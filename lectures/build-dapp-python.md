# Building a DApp in Python
In this lecture we will build a DApp frontend in the Python language, using the [Flask](https://flask.pocoo.org) framework.

## Getting started
For this project we will need to install a few python packages.
```bash
$ pip3 install flask, web3
$ pip3 install "eth-utils>=1.2.0"
```
